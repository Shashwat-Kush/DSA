//O is the upper bound of the time complexity of the algo.
//Θ is the avg time complexity of the algo
//Ω is the lower bound of the time complexity of the algo.
//O(1) --> constant time complexity
//O(log n) --> logarithmic time complexity

//O(n log n) --> linearithmic time complexity
//O(n^2) --> quadratic time complexity
